# What is Barka?

Barka is the first **progressive CMS built for AI agents**. It bridges the gap between static site generators and traditional content management systems — combining the simplicity of Astro/Hugo (Markdown files, free hosting) with the power of Drupal/WordPress (structured content, page builder, multi-language, admin UI).

**Born from real frustration.** Barka was created after extensive work with AI coding agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Copilot) on existing CMS platforms — Payload, Astro, Drupal, WordPress, Strapi. The problems hit hardest in the scenarios that matter most for marketing teams: multi-language sites across multiple domains, rapid creation of custom landing pages, and high-volume content publishing (blog posts, case studies, service pages). Every existing CMS made these tasks painful with AI — complex configs, binary formats, database-dependent workflows, and opaque abstractions meant that building a simple landing page with AI required fighting the framework instead of creating content.

**Barka is designed to be the #1 CMS for marketing-driven companies** that need rich, multi-language websites across multiple domains — and need to publish a lot, fast. With AI agents, you can generate a complete landing page with 10 sections in minutes, translate it to 3 languages instantly, and deploy to a new domain without touching the admin panel. Barka was built to eliminate every barrier between "I need a page" and "it's live."

**Designed from the ground up for AI-assisted development.** Content in Markdown, config in YAML, themes in JSX — all plain text formats that AI coding agents can read, modify, and extend without APIs or authentication. The repo ships with `CLAUDE.md` and `INVARIANTS.json` — built-in guardrails that keep AI agents aligned with project rules across tasks. An AI agent can create an entire website — content, theme, config — in a single session.

**No database required to start.** Content lives in Markdown files and YAML configs — version-controlled with Git, deployable to Cloudflare Pages for $0. When editors need a UI, add SQLite with one command and unlock a full admin panel.

## Why Barka?

- **Built for AI Agents** — Every file is plain text (Markdown, YAML, JSX). AI tools can create content, add features, modify themes, and extend the CMS — no API calls, no auth tokens, no binary formats. Ships with agent guardrails (`CLAUDE.md`, `INVARIANTS.json`) to prevent drift across tasks.
- **Progressive Complexity** — Start with files only, add a database when you actually need one. No upfront infrastructure decisions.
- **Zero JavaScript on Frontend** — Public pages ship 0 bytes of JS. Pure server-rendered HTML with perfect Lighthouse scores.
- **Full Code Ownership** — No vendor lock-in, no SaaS fees. Your content lives in Git. Self-host anywhere or deploy static for free.
- **Drupal-Grade Features** — Page builder with 15 section types, multi-language, multi-site, taxonomy, revisions — without the Drupal complexity.

---

# Features

**Content as Code**
Write content in Markdown with YAML frontmatter. Define content types, taxonomies, and section types in simple YAML config files. Everything is a file — version-controlled, diffable, AI-friendly.

**Page Builder — 15 Section Types**
Compose landing pages from reusable sections: Hero, Features, CTA, Testimonials, FAQ, Pricing, Gallery, Counters, Logo Slider, Text with Image, Blog Listing, Columns, Video, Form, and Text — inspired by [Droopler](https://droopler.dev). Each section supports per-instance settings (background, spacing, width, CSS class).

**Single Directory Components (SDC)**
Each section component lives in its own directory with co-located template (`.tsx`), scoped styles (`.css`), and schema definition (`schema.yaml`). CSS is automatically collected and served via a dynamic `/static/components.css` route — no build step needed.

```
themes/lokatech/components/
├── hero/
│   ├── hero.tsx          # Hono JSX template
│   ├── hero.css          # Scoped styles (animations, gradients)
│   └── schema.yaml       # Field definitions
├── features/
│   ├── features.tsx
│   ├── features.css
│   └── schema.yaml
└── ... (15 components)
```

**Starter Profiles (Distributions)**
Self-contained starter profiles — like Drupal distributions (Droopler, OpenIntranet). Each starter bundles themes, config, and demo content. After `barka init`, everything in `content/`, `config/`, and `themes/` is yours — framework updates never touch these directories.

**Admin UI with HTMX**
A full content management interface at `/admin` — content CRUD with revisions, section builder, media library, taxonomy management, user accounts, settings. Built with server-rendered HTML + HTMX for instant interactivity. No React, no JS build step.

**Multi-Language**
Built-in i18n via filename suffixes (`about.pl.md`, `about.de.md`). Language negotiation (URL prefix → cookie → Accept-Language). Hreflang tags auto-generated. A scalable **language switcher** (dropdown: code + label, active checkmark) lives in the header and matches mobile drawer styling. On the **default language**, URLs have no prefix (`/`); prefixed routes (`/pl/...`, `/de/...`) serve the matching translation. If two files share the same slug (e.g. `page.md` and `page.pl.md`), the unprefixed URL always resolves to the **site default language** — not “first file on disk.” Listings (`/articles`, `/case-studies`, `/services`) filter by language so you never mix EN and PL on the same index. Config in one YAML file:

```yaml
# config/languages.yaml
default: en
languages:
  en:
    label: "English"
    direction: ltr
  pl:
    label: "Polski"
    direction: ltr
```

**UI strings (theme / admin copy)**
Navigation labels, mega-menu copy, footer headings, and other **non-content** strings are not stored in Markdown. They live in `config/translations/<lang>.yaml` (dot keys, e.g. `nav.services: "Services"`). At render time the active theme receives a Drupal-style **`t()`** helper via theme settings (`themeSettings._t`) with fallback to the site default language. Add or edit keys there — same idea as Drupal’s string translations.

**Base path & internal URLs**
Templates get **`_basePath`** (empty for the default language, or `/<lang>` when prefixed) and **`_url('/path')`** so links stay correct when the user is on `/pl/...` (logo, nav, footer, CTAs). You don’t hardcode `/pl` in JSX.

**Multi-Site / Multi-Domain**
Serve multiple sites from a single Barka instance. Each site can have its own domain, language set, and theme settings — while sharing the same components and content engine. Content **without** optional `siteId` in frontmatter is **shared** across sites; content **with** `siteId` is scoped to that site. `barka dev` prints a table mapping each site’s production domain to its `.localhost` alias and languages. Local development uses RFC 6761 `.localhost` subdomains (zero config, no `/etc/hosts` editing):

```yaml
# config/sites.yaml
sites:
  main:
    label: "Barka"
    domain: "barka.dev"
    localhost: "barka.localhost"        # http://barka.localhost:3000
    default_lang: en
    languages: [en, pl, de]

  blog:
    label: "Blog"
    domain: "blog.barka.dev"
    localhost: "blog.localhost"         # http://blog.localhost:3000
    default_lang: en
    languages: [en]
```

**Themes**
Drupal-style theme system with inheritance and a resolution chain: `active theme → base theme → built-in fallback`. Themes include layouts, SDC components, partials, and static assets. Slug-specific templates (`page--contact.tsx`), collection listings (`index--articles.tsx`). Shipped inside starters so they're fully customizable.

**Bidirectional Sync**
Edit in files, edit in admin UI — it all stays in sync. `barka sync` merges changes from both directions with conflict detection. Export from DB to files for Git versioning anytime.

**SEO-First**
Zero JS on public pages. Auto-generated meta tags (Open Graph, Twitter), JSON-LD structured data, sitemap.xml, robots.txt, RSS feed, clean URLs, hreflang tags. Sitemap and RSS are **site-scoped** when multi-site is enabled. Static HTML output scores 100/100 on Lighthouse.

**Themed 404**
Unknown routes render through your active theme (navigation, language switcher, translated UI) — not a bare HTML error page.

**Mobile-First Navigation**
Responsive design with a hamburger menu that opens a slide-in drawer with full accordion sub-navigation (Services, Industries, Insights sub-items), app-style bottom navigation bar, and a prominent Contact CTA.

# Quickstart

**Step 1:** Create a new Barka project:

```bash
npx @barkajs/barka create my-site
```

**Step 2:** Install dependencies and start:

```bash
cd my-site
npm install
npm run dev
```

**Step 4:** Open your site at `http://localhost:3000`

**Step 5 (optional):** Add a database and admin UI:

```bash
npx barka db:init
```

Access the admin panel at `http://localhost:3000/admin`
Default credentials: `admin@example.com` / `Admin123!SecurePass`

## Prerequisites

- Node.js v20+
- npm, pnpm, or bun

That's it. No Docker, no PostgreSQL, no Redis — unless you want them later.

<h2 id="starters">Starter Profiles</h2>

Starters are self-contained distributions — like Drupal installation profiles (Droopler, OpenIntranet). Each starter bundles a premium theme, full configuration, demo content, and translations. After `barka init`, everything becomes yours to customize. More starters are coming.

```bash
barka starters                       # list available starters
barka init --starter lokatech        # enterprise IT company
barka init --starter kadoservices    # staffing & HR company
barka init --starter blank           # clean starting point
```

### LokaTech — Enterprise IT Demo (default)

A complete website for a fictional enterprise IT services company. Dark navy + emerald green theme with premium animations (floating blobs, grid patterns, glow lines, stagger reveals).

- **Content**: 62 files — 6 services, 6 industries, 8 case studies, 22 articles, 5 team members, 5 locations, homepage with 10 sections
- **Theme**: 14 layouts, 15 SDC section components, CSS-only mega menu, mobile drawer nav, frosted glass header
- **Languages**: EN + PL translations, language switcher, hreflang tags
- **Use case**: IT outsourcing, software house, digital agency, consulting firm

### KadoServices — Staffing & HR Demo

A complete website for a fictional staffing and HR services company. Warm amber + deep plum theme with a completely different visual language (numbered rows, split hero, dual CTA, slim dropdowns).

- **Content**: 42 files — 6 services (recruitment, temp staffing, RPO, consulting, branding, payroll), 6 industries, 3 case studies, 4 articles, 5 team members, 4 locations, homepage with 10 sections
- **Theme**: 14 layouts, 15 SDC components, DM Sans + Source Sans 3 typography, pre-footer dual audience strip
- **Languages**: EN + PL translations
- **Use case**: Staffing agency, HR consulting, recruitment firm, outsourcing company

### Blank — Clean Starting Point

Minimal setup for starting from scratch. Just a homepage, about page, and the base Starter theme.

- **Content**: 2 files — homepage + about page
- **Config**: 3 content types (article, page, landing_page)
- **Theme**: Starter base theme (clean, unstyled)
- **Use case**: Custom project where you build your own theme and content

### How to use a starter for a new site

```bash
# Create a new project
npx @barkajs/barka create my-company
cd my-company && npm install

# Pick a starter that matches your industry
barka init --starter kadoservices --force

# Customize: edit content, change colors, add your logo
# Then start the dev server
barka dev
```

After init, you own everything:
- `content/` — your content, edit freely (or let AI agents generate it)
- `config/` — your content types, taxonomies, languages, sites
- `themes/` — your theme layouts, components, styles

Framework updates (`npm update @barkajs/barka`) never touch these directories.

## For AI Coding Agents

Copy the prompt below into **Claude Code**, **Cursor**, **Codex**, **Aider**, or any AI coding tool to start building a new Barka site from scratch. The agent will ask you a few questions, recommend the best starter, and generate a customized website.

````markdown
# Build a new website with Barka CMS

## Step 1 — Set up the project

```bash
npx @barkajs/barka create my-site
cd my-site
npm install
```

Read the files `CLAUDE.md` and `INVARIANTS.json` in the project root before making
any changes — they contain the rules you must follow.

## Step 2 — Gather requirements

Before choosing a starter or generating content, ask me (the human) these questions
and wait for answers:

1. **Company / website name** — What is the company called? What should the site title be?
2. **Main goal** — What is the primary goal of the website?
   (lead generation, brand awareness, recruitment, e-commerce, portfolio, internal tool, etc.)
3. **Services / products** — What does the company offer? List the main services or product categories.
4. **Target audience** — Who are the ideal customers? Which industries or verticals?
5. **Languages** — How many languages are needed and which ones? (e.g. EN + PL, EN only, EN + DE + FR)
6. **Brand identity** — Do you have a brand book, existing website, or logo I can use to match colors and typography? Paste a link or describe the palette.
7. **Content volume** — How much content do you plan to publish?
   (a few static pages, regular blog posts, case studies, landing pages for campaigns, etc.)

## Step 3 — Choose a starter and initialize

Based on the answers, pick the best starter:

| Starter | Best for | Theme style |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| `lokatech` | IT services, software houses, consulting, digital agencies | Dark navy + emerald, premium animations |
| `kadoservices` | HR, staffing, recruitment, outsourcing, business services | Warm amber + deep plum, professional |
| `blank` | Fully custom design, e-commerce, portfolio, non-standard layouts | Minimal base theme |

> More industry-specific starters are coming (healthcare, real estate, SaaS, education).
> For now, pick the closest match and customize from there.

```bash
barka init --starter <recommended> --force
```

## Step 4 — Customize for the company

1. Edit `config/settings.yaml` — set `site_name`, `site_url`, `tagline`, and theme colors
   to match the brand book or provided palette.
2. Edit `config/languages.yaml` — configure the languages from the requirements.
3. Edit `config/sites.yaml` — set the production domain and localhost alias.
4. Update `config/translations/en.yaml` (and other language files) — replace demo
   navigation labels, footer text, and CTA copy with the real company content.

## Step 5 — Generate content

Replace the demo content in `content/` with real pages tailored to the company:

- `content/landing-pages/homepage.yaml` — hero, features, CTA, testimonials sections
- `content/pages/about.md` — company story, mission, values
- `content/services/*.md` — one file per service/product
- `content/articles/*.md` — blog posts relevant to the industry
- `content/landing-pages/*.yaml` — campaign landing pages with section builder

For each non-default language, create translated files with the language suffix
(e.g. `homepage.pl.yaml`, `about.pl.md`).

## Step 6 — Preview and iterate

```bash
barka dev
# Open http://localhost:3000
```

Use Playwright or a browser to verify every page renders correctly.
Check all languages, navigation, footer links, and mobile responsiveness.

## Rules to follow

- NEVER delete content/, config/, or themes/ directories
- NEVER hardcode language prefixes (/pl/, /de/) — use `_url()` and `_t()` in templates
- ALWAYS run `npm test && npm run typecheck` before committing
- Content files use YAML frontmatter; landing pages are pure YAML with sections
- Theme components are Single Directory Components (SDC) in `themes/<name>/components/`
- UI strings live in `config/translations/<lang>.yaml` — not hardcoded in JSX
````

# CLI

```bash
barka create <name>           # Scaffold a new project
barka init -s <starter>       # Initialize from a starter profile (lokatech, blank)
barka starters                # List available starter profiles
barka dev                     # Dev server with hot reload
barka build                   # Static HTML output to dist/
barka build --site X          # Build for a specific site
barka db:init                 # Initialize SQLite + seed data
barka import                  # Files → Database
barka export                  # Database → Files
barka sync                    # Bidirectional sync with conflict detection
```

---

# Content

Content lives in `content/` as Markdown with YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
title: "Getting Started with Barka"
type: article
status: published
date: 2026-03-21
fields:
  category: technology
  author: "Jane Doe"
  featured_image: "/static/images/article-hero.jpg"
---

Your markdown content here. Supports **bold**, *italic*, [links](https://example.com),
code blocks, images, and everything else Markdown offers.
```

Landing pages use pure YAML with sections:

```yaml
title: "Homepage"
type: landing_page
status: published
sections:
  - type: hero
    heading: "Build websites the simple way"
    subheading: "Content in files. Deploy anywhere."
    cta_text: "Get Started"
    cta_url: "/docs"
    settings:
      background: dark
      spacing: large
  - type: features
    heading: "Why Barka?"
    items:
      - title: "Files First"
        description: "No database needed to start"
        icon: "file-text"
```

## Multi-Language Content

Add a translation by creating a file with a language suffix:

```
content/
├── articles/
│   ├── platform-engineering.md       # English (default)
│   └── platform-engineering.pl.md    # Polish translation
├── pages/
│   ├── contact.md                    # English
│   └── contact.pl.md                # Polish
└── landing-pages/
    ├── homepage.yaml                 # English
    └── homepage.pl.yaml             # Polish
```

The system automatically detects the language from the filename, associates translations with the same slug, and serves them at prefixed URLs (`/pl/articles/platform-engineering`).

**Missing translation:** If there is no content file for a language (e.g. no German homepage), that URL may show a **404** — UI chrome still uses `config/translations/de.yaml` for nav/footer. Add `homepage.de.yaml` (or the relevant `.de.md`) when you want a full page.

---

# Configuration

All configuration in `config/` — simple YAML files:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `settings.yaml` | Site name, URL, theme, SEO defaults |
| `content-types.yaml` | Content type definitions with fields |
| `section-types.yaml` | Section types for the page builder |
| `languages.yaml` | i18n language definitions |
| `taxonomies.yaml` | Vocabularies and terms |
| `sites.yaml` | Multi-site domains, per-site languages, `.localhost` aliases |
| `translations/*.yaml` | UI strings per language (`en.yaml`, `pl.yaml`, …) — keys consumed by `t()` in themes |

---

<h2 id="testing-smoke">Smoke tests (manual / Playwright)</h2>

After changes to routing, i18n, `sites.yaml`, or theme navigation, verify at least:

| Area | Checks |
|------|--------|
| **EN** | `/` — logo → `/`, nav without `/pl`, English body copy |
| **PL** | `/pl` — logo → `/pl`, nav/footer links prefixed `/pl/`, Polish copy where translated |
| **Same slug, two langs** | `/services/...` = default lang; `/pl/services/...` = Polish — no cross-leak |
| **Listings** | `/articles` vs `/pl/articles` — only items for that language |
| **404** | `/missing` vs `/pl/missing` — themed page + matching nav language |
| **Switcher** | Dropdown lists all configured languages; links use correct prefix |

The Barka wrapper documents a fuller checklist in `.claude/skills/role-qa-testing/SKILL.md` (section **Frontend Smoke Tests — Barka v2**).
